# Implementation Plan: Dear.exe Mobile Drop Experience

## Overview

Rework Dear.exe into a mobile-first private sharing app where a person can send a photo, GIF, meme, or text letter as a “drop.” Use the three mobile concept directions already reviewed as visual references: bold cobalt and warm paper, oversized media previews, playful stamps, and expressive but quick send/open moments. “Drop” is a working product term, not a permanent rename. Sending stays one-to-one in the first release; delivery is instant by default, with the existing human relay as an optional slower journey. There will be no public discovery feed in this release.

The app keeps its current Next.js, React, Tailwind, Supabase, local draft, mailbox, and relay foundations. Existing letters continue to work as text drops, and their routes and saved content remain readable. The build covers the end-to-end mobile flow: choose content, attach an image or GIF, choose a recipient, send, open, react, and optionally follow a relay.

## Implementation Status — 2026-10-18

- Task 1 is complete. The mixed-payload model, default text behavior for older drafts, and compatible recipient routes are in place.
- The core mobile sharing, receive, reaction, and optional relay flows have local implementations. Detailed code and browser checks are recorded in `tasks/todo.md`.
- Seeded demo reactions now persist on this device and appear on the mailbox card; they are clearly marked as local and do not notify a sender.
- Signed-in mailbox cards now show participant-visible reactions on sent drops; hosted account-to-account verification remains open.
- Hosted account-to-account sending, storage privacy, reactions, and relay still need verification because this checkout has no Supabase project configuration. Real-device safe-area, keyboard, and reduced-motion checks also remain open.

## Workspace and Delivery

- `/drop` is the new app and the only write target. `/letter` is read-only inspiration; source files and its existing uncommitted work must remain untouched.
- Use the existing empty private GitHub repository `arjeetanand/drop`. Copy the working app into this folder without `.git`, environment secrets, generated output, or installed dependencies; preserve the plan files already here.
- Verify each implementation slice before committing and push each passing commit to `main`.
- The earlier design chat did not record a final selection. Use its playful paper direction as the default: warm paper, cobalt actions, expressive media, small postmark details, and thumb-first navigation.

## Product Scope and Decisions

- **Core payloads:** text/letter, photo or meme image, and GIF. A meme is an image with an optional caption. Upload from the device first; defer a searchable third-party GIF catalog until a provider is selected.
- **Sharing:** one recipient per drop for v1. Keep the interface ready for groups, but defer group data and permissions until the one-to-one flow is solid.
- **Delivery:** instant is the default. Human relay is an explicit choice for a drop that should travel hand to hand. Map and route details appear only in relay mode.
- **Privacy:** drops are private to sender and recipient. Media uses private storage and recipient-aware access. Do not expose public asset URLs or precise location in the normal sharing flow.
- **Local demo:** seeded examples can demonstrate image/GIF cards. Real media delivery requires the configured Supabase account and private storage; drafts should clearly show if a file has not uploaded yet.
- **Out of scope for v1:** public feed, likes/follows, group chats, video/audio recording, GIF search provider, and a permanent brand rename.

## Architecture Decisions

- Keep existing routes and components where practical. Update the interface language to “drops” while retaining `/letter/[id]` links and the current relay routes for saved content and shared links.
- Add an explicit payload kind and delivery mode to the existing draft/letter model. Treat records without a payload kind as text so local drafts, seeded examples, and existing Supabase rows remain compatible.
- Store only private storage paths and media metadata with a drop. Upload files to a private Supabase Storage bucket and return short-lived authorized URLs only when sender or recipient opens the drop. Validate file type and size at the upload boundary.
- Reuse the current local draft store and Supabase client. Do not add a client state or animation dependency for this redesign.
- Build mobile first with a thumb-friendly bottom navigation, safe-area spacing, large media previews, and concise screens. Keep a responsive desktop layout using the same information hierarchy.
- Use short, clear CSS transitions for send/open feedback and honor `prefers-reduced-motion`. Keep relay maps, tracking events, and handoff flows behind the explicit relay choice.
- Before the first source-code change, follow the project’s `AGENTS.md` instruction and read the relevant installed Next.js guide from `node_modules/next/dist/docs/`.
- Preserve the current uncommitted prompt and seal changes in `app/page.tsx`, `app/compose/*`, and `data/mockData.ts` when integrating the new flow.
- Commit each completed code change separately with a descriptive message, then push it to `origin` at `https://github.com/arjeetanand/drop.git`. Keep unrelated pre-existing changes out of each commit.

## Task List

### Phase 1: Data and Media Foundation

- [x] Task 1: Add the mixed-payload model with backward-compatible text defaults.
- [ ] Task 2: Add private image/GIF upload and recipient-authorized reads.

### Checkpoint: Foundation

- [ ] Existing local and Supabase letters still load as text drops.
- [ ] An authenticated sender can upload an allowed image/GIF and only the sender or recipient can retrieve it.
- [ ] No existing stored letter or draft is overwritten by the new fields.

### Phase 2: Mobile Sharing Flow

- [ ] Task 3: Rework the mobile home, mailbox, and navigation around drops.
- [ ] Task 4: Turn the composer into a single mobile-first drop flow.

### Checkpoint: Sending

- [ ] A person can create and send a text, image/meme, or GIF drop to one recipient.
- [ ] Instant delivery works without showing a map; relay is an intentional choice.
- [ ] Current writing prompts and seal choices still work where they apply to text drops.

### Phase 3: Receiving and Relay

- [ ] Task 5: Make received drops open in the right media format and support a private reaction.
- [ ] Task 6: Keep the existing human relay as an optional mode for any supported drop.

### Checkpoint: End-to-End

- [ ] Sender and recipient can complete the send, open, and react flow on a phone-sized viewport.
- [ ] Existing letter links and relay history still open correctly.

### Phase 4: Mobile Polish

- [ ] Task 7: Tune accessibility, motion, responsive behavior, and release checks.

### Checkpoint: Complete

- [ ] Lint, typecheck, and production build pass.
- [ ] Manual mobile checks pass at 360px, 390px, and 430px widths, including keyboard and safe-area behavior.
- [ ] Reduced-motion mode and desktop layout remain usable.

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Existing data and links are letter-specific. | Old drafts, mailbox cards, or shared links could disappear. | Make payload fields additive, default old records to text, and retain current routes and hydration behavior. |
| Supabase currently stores letter text but has no media bucket. | Uploads could be inaccessible or leak through public URLs. | Add a private bucket and explicit storage policies for sender/recipient access; verify policies with two different accounts. |
| Large or unsupported uploads can break mobile composition. | Slow uploads, storage waste, or failed sends. | Accept only image formats and GIF for v1, enforce a documented size cap, show upload progress/failure, and keep the draft recoverable. |
| The current local demo has no durable media backend. | A local preview could look sent but vanish after reload. | Mark unuploaded media as local preview, offer seeded media in demo mode, and only report success after a persistent upload and drop save. |
| Existing relay screens and their map/location model are more elaborate than instant sharing needs. | The default flow could feel slow or expose unnecessary location. | Keep relay optional and preserve map details only in that mode; request location only when the user starts a relay action. |
| Existing user changes overlap the home and composer. | The redesign could erase current writing prompts or seal choices. | Integrate with the current working tree and inspect the diff before editing those files. |

## Open Questions

- Keep “Dear.exe” as the brand and use “Drop” only for the shared item until a brand decision is made.
- Revisit group sharing and GIF search after the one-to-one image/GIF flow is working.
- Confirm the upload size cap against the configured Supabase plan during implementation; the initial design should surface the limit before upload.
